# Materialista - Real state CMS

## What is this?

Materialista is a free and open-source content manager for easily publishing real state offer. For now it basically consists of a dashboard or administrator side where you can edit and upload new real state ads, and a public side where anyone can look for ads and check the real state offer you have previously published.

## The tech and the libs

* Laravel 5.2
* JQuery
* Bootstrap
* Font-awesome
* Other JQuery plugins...

## The looks

The front end design of Materialista is inspired by the famous web site [http://idealista.com](http://idealista.com). The back end design is based on a [Metronic](http://keenthemes.com/metronic-theme/) template.

## The story about the app

I wrote this app arround two years ago as a personal exercise more than anything else. In fact, I think it was the second Laravel app I wrote! Since I was not very experienced with the framework, I'm sure I didn't write the code as elegantly as any Laravel project deserves. Anyway, the app is quite functional, I keep it updated and I promise to improve it in my free time.

## Contributing...

If you feel like working on this app yourself, feel free to do it. Of course, I would appreciate if you contact me and tell me about it, but it is not really necessary. If you find any bugs, mistakes, security issues... I'll be very thankful if you share them with me.    

## Documentation

Since this is a little app for my personal use I haven't written any documentation for it. Anyway, if you know how to use Laravel I expect that you won't have any problem understanding the main aspects of this app.

## License

Materialista is an open-source Laravel app under the [MIT license](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT). Laravel, any of the Laravel packages, the Metronic template, JQuery and all the JQuery plugins are all subject to their own licenses.
